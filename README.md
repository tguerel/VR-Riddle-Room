# VR-Riddle-Room
A VR Room with a riddle in it (school exercise to get accustomed to VR developing mechanics/workflow)

Created on Windows 10 in Unity 2019.1.14f1 using SteamVR 2.5.0 (sdk 1.8.19) and Visual Studio 7.7.2.21

## Progress:

* Successfully set up Unity Project and Repository
* Cloned project to local PC
* Tested SteamVR functionality, result positive
* Grayboxing in progress

### Process 
Downloaded and imported SteamVR, set up plane and default prefabs like "Teleporting", "Player" and deleted Main Camera since one 
is generated anyway.
Then dublicated the plane, put "Teleporting Area" script on the upper place that is moved up on the y-axis a little to avoid collisions.
Also set a few "Teleport Points" and then tested if it's successfully up and running. 

Here's a few sketches i'm basing my room design and mood off of:
